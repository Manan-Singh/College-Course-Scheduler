# College-Course-Scheduler
An application for college students. It displays a Monday to Friday week on a GUI made in JavaFx and allows the user to add, remove, and save courses onto it. There are two reasons I made it. The first is simply because I hated the ugly UI that my school used to display our courses. Plus, with this application everything is saved directly on the computer, there's no need to log on to a website to check your schedule. The second reason is that whenever I wanted to create a course schedule for the next semester, I had trouble organizing myself and deciding which courses to take since there would be so many timing conflicts. With this you can experiment with different schedules by adding and removing courses to see which best suits you.
